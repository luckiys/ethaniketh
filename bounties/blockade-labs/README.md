# Bounty: Blockade Labs — Solving the Homeless Agent Problem

**Sponsor:** Blockade Labs
**Prize:** $2,000
**Promo Code:** ETHDEN26 (free Skybox AI API access)

## What We Built

Every Mudra agent is homeless no more. Each agent (Watcher, Strategist, Executor) gets a **3D immersive skybox environment** generated by Skybox AI that reflects their trading personality and risk profile.

### Agent Homes

| Agent | Home | Personality |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Watcher | Cosmic Observatory | Calm, infinite surveillance |
| Strategist | Crystalline War Room | Precise, confident, analytical |
| Executor | Quantum Trading Floor | Relentless, electric, fast |

### Risk-Adaptive Environments
- **Conservative** → muted colors, serene horizon, stable
- **Moderate** → balanced palette, dynamic but controlled
- **Aggressive** → high contrast, electric, maximum energy

## Demo

```bash
cd frontend && npm run dev

# All 3 agent homes
curl http://localhost:3000/api/agent-home

# Single agent
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/agent-home?agent=watcher"

# Generate new home with risk level
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/agent-home \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent": "strategist", "riskScore": 75}'
```
